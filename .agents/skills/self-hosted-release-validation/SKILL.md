# OSS Self-Hosted Release Validation

- Validate self-hosted releases through the documented newcomer path: a clean Docker Compose project, loopback-only ports unless explicitly testing exposure, the default SQLite-backed data volume, Admin UI/API startup, first-run model configuration, a representative source sync, memory retrieval, and the packaged local MCP path.
- `scripts/compose_smoke.sh` runs this newcomer path in an isolated Compose project (add `--ollama` or export `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for the model, sync and retrieval steps) and prints a table for the PR or release notes.
- Use an isolated Compose project and dedicated volume for smoke tests. Never reuse or delete a developer's existing MemForge volume, source data, plugin cache, or external service state merely to obtain a clean result.
- Prove SQLite persistence by restarting the API or Compose stack against the same isolated data volume and rechecking sources, documents, memories, keyword/vector health, and MCP retrieval.
- Treat source support as an execution matrix, not a registry count. For each registered source type, state whether server collection, local-agent collection, managed intake, credentials, browser sessions, VPN/internal reachability, or an external provider is required. Classify each type as verified, unsupported by design, blocked by a missing prerequisite, or failed.
- Exercise local-agent sources through the real server-issued job and daemon path. A direct package injection may diagnose the service boundary, but it does not prove that the documented daemon workflow works.
- For public-beta readiness, separately assess newcomer reproducibility, first-run UX, error messages, documentation accuracy, default data/privacy boundaries, and obvious exposure or secret-handling footguns. Give a conservative `GO`, `CONDITIONAL GO`, or `NO-GO`, with the smallest required fixes or disclosure language.
- Do not present fixture-backed LLM/provider behavior as production-provider validation. Record the fixture contract, then distinguish it from real connector credentials and model-provider coverage.
